//by Ankita Gupta

// There are two assembly lines. Each assembly line has n stations.
// Every station has some dedicated job that needs to done. For a station number i, you can get the job done on station number i of any assembly line.
// You can go to station i only when you have been through station i-1.
// From a station i, you can either go to the next station on the same line or you can transfer assebly line.
// For moving in same assembly line no extra charges will be taken
// For moving from assembly line 1 to assembly line 2 or vice versa from i-1 to i, transfer charge will be caused

// Information provided â€“
// time to enter station 1 on both assembly lines
// time to exit last station on both lines
// job processing time for every station
// The time to transfer from each station of assembly line 1 to next station of assembly line 2 is given
// The time to transfer from each station of assembly line 2 to next station of assembly line 1

// Objective of the problem is to finish all the jobs in minimum time.
