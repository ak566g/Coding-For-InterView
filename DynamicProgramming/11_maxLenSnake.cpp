// Given a grid of numbers, find maximum length Snake sequence and print it. 
// If multiple snake sequences exists with the maximum length, print any one of them.
// A snake sequence is made up of adjacent numbers in the grid such that for each number, 
// the number on the right or the number below it is +1 or -1 its value. 
// For example, 
// if you are at location (x, y) in the grid, you can either move right i.e. (x, y+1) if that number is ± 1 or move down i.e. (x+1, y) if that number is ± 1.
