    at the last empty position 0 will be added
    Just like number * 2
Right Shift >>

    At the begginning, at the empty 
        If number is positive   0 will be appended 
        If number is negative   1 will be appended

Bitwise and &
    0 & 1 = 0
    1 & 0 = 0
    0 & 0 = 0
    1 & 1 = 1

Bitwise or |
    0 | 1 = 1
    1 | 0 = 1
    0 | 0 = 0
    1 | 1 = 1
    
Bitwise not ~
    ~ 0 = 1
    ~ 1 = 0
    ~0100 = 1011(Negative 5, msb will be changed)

Bitwise xor ^
    0 ^ 1 = 1
    1 ^ 0 = 1
    0 ^ 0 = 0
    1 ^ 1 = 0
